# Eckstein-Keane-Wolpin models

We present background material on a class of structural microeconometric models to facilitate transdiciplinary collaboration in their future development. We describe the economic framework, mathematical formulation, and calibration procedures for so-called Eckstein-Keane-Wolpin (EKW) models. We specify, simulate, and calibrate an example using our groupâ€™s research codes `respy` and `estimagic`. We summarize our efforts drawing on research outside economics to address their computational challenges and improve their reliability and interpretability.

This material is under constant development but you can access its most recent version [here
