# Eckstein-Keane-Wolpin models

We present background material for a particular class structural economic models to facilitate transdiciplinary collaboration in their future development. We describe the economic setup, mathematical formulation, and calibration procedures for so-called Eckstein-Keane-Wolpin (EKW) models. We provide an example application using our group's research code `respy`. We review research outside economics to identify model components ripe for improvement and explore possible model extensions.
