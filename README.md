# Eckstein-Keane-Wolpin models

We present background material on a particular class of structural microeconometric models to facilitate transdiciplinary collaboration in their future development. We describe the economic framework, mathematical formulation, and calibration procedures for so-called Eckstein-Keane-Wolpin (EKW) models. We specify, simulate, and calibrate an example using our groupâ€™s research codes `respy` and `estimagic`. We summarize our efforts that draw on research outside economics to address their computational challenges and improve their usefulness.
