\section{Introduction}

\noindent Economists use structural microeconometric models to study individual decision-making. In these models, the objective of the individuals, their economic environment, and the institutional and informational constraints under which they operate are clearly specified. They are calibrated to reproduce observed data on individual individual decisions and experiences. Based on the results, researchers can quantify the importance of competing economic mechanisms in determining economic outcomes and forecast the effects of policy proposals \citep{Wolpin.2013}.\\

\noindent We restrict our exposition to the class of Eckstein-Keane-Wolpin (EKW) models \citep{Adda.2017, Blundell.2016, Keane.1997}. Labor economists use this class to study human capital investment decisions. Human capital is the knowledge, skills, competencies, and attributes embodied in individuals that facilitate the creation of personal, social, and economic well-being \citep{Becker.1964}. Differences in human capital attainment are a major determinant of inequality in a variety of life outcomes such as labor market success and health across and within countries \citep{OECD.2001}.

In \citet{Bhuller.2018}, for example, we apply an EKW model to analyze the mechanisms determining schooling decisions in Norway. We calibrate the model using Norwegian population panel data with nearly career-long earnings histories  After validating our model using an mandatory schooling reform, we use it to gain insights into the underlying economic mechanisms that generate the resulting increase in average years of schooling and are able to forecast the effect of several policy alternatives.\\

\noindent We present background material for this particular class structural economic models to facilitate transdiciplinary collaboration in their future development. We proceed as follows. We first describe the economic framework, mathematical formulation, and calibration procedure. We then specify, simulate, and calibrate an example using our group's research codes \verb+respy+ and \verb+estimagic+. We conclude by summarizing our efforts to draw on research outside economics to address their computational challenges and improve their usefulness.\\

\noindent Throughout, we only offer a limited number of seminal references and textbooks that invite further study. We introduce acronyms and symbols as needed and our notation draws on the reviews by \cite{Aguirregabiria.2010}, \cite{Arcidiacono.2011}, and \cite{Puterman.1994}.
