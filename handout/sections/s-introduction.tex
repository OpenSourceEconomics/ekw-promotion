\section{Introduction}

\paragraph{Focus of handout} We present background material for a particular class structural economic models to facilitate transdiciplinary collaboration in their future development. We describe the economic setup, mathematical formulation, and calibration procedures for the so-called Eckstein-Keane-Wolpin (EKW) models \citep{Aguirregabiria.2010}. We provide an example application using our group's research code \verb+respy+ \citep{respy-1.0}. We draw on research outside economics to identify model components ripe for improvement and explore possible extensions.

\paragraph{Structural models}  Structural economic models clearly specify an individual's objective and the constraints of their economic environment under which they operate. They are used to quantify the importance of competing economic mechanisms in determining economic outcomes and evaluate the effects of alternative policies before their implementation \citep{Wolpin.2013}.

\paragraph{EKW models} We restrict us to the class of Eckstein-Keane-Wolpin (EKW) models. Labor economists often apply these models for the analysis of human capital investment decisions. Differences in human capital attainment are a major determinant of inequality in a variety of life outcomes such as labor market success and educational attainment across
and within countries.

\citet{Bhuller.2018}, for example, build a model to analyze the mechanisms determining schooling decisions in Norway. They find an important role for the option value of schooling, which measures the value of the information generated by each additional year of schooling.
After validating their model using an increase in mandatory schooling, they then use the model to study the underlying mechanisms that generate the increase of average years of schooling and evaluate the effects of several policy alternatives.

\paragraph{Notation} Throughout, we only provide a very limited number of references and only point to related textbooks instead. We will introduce acronyms and symbols as needed, but a full list of both is provided in the Appendix. The notation draws form the related work by \cite{Puterman.1994}, \cite{Aguirregabiria.2010}, and \cite{Arcidiacono.2011}.

\paragraph{Stucture} This handout is structured as follows. We first present the basic setup, then offer an example implementation using the \verb+respy+ package, and finally we outline possible improvements and extensions.
