\subsection{Calibration procedure}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EKW models are calibrated to data on observed individual decisions and experiences to back out information on reward functions, preference parameters, and transition probabilities.  This requires the full parameterization $\theta$ of the model.\\

\noindent Economists have access to observations for $i = 1, \hdots, N$ individuals in each time period $t$. For every observation $(i, t)$ in the data, we observe action $a_{it}$ and a subset $x_{it}$ of the state $s_{it}$. Therefore, from an economist's point of view, we need to distinguish between two types of state variables $s_{it} = (x_{it}, \epsilon_{it})$. Variables $x_{it}$ are observed by the economist and the individual $i$ at time $t$, while $\epsilon_{it}$ are only observed by the individual. In addition, some realizations of the rewards $r_{it} = r_t(x_{it}, \epsilon_{it}, a_{it})$ are recorded as well. In summary, the data $\mathcal{D}$ has the following structure:
%
\begin{align*}
  \mathcal{D} = \{a_{it}, x_{it}, r_{it}: i = 1,2, \hdots, N; t = 1, \hdots, T_i\},
\end{align*}
where $T_i$ is the number of observations for which we observe individual $i$.\\

\noindent Numerous calibration procedures exist that are tailored to different settings \citep{Davidson.2003, Gourieroux.1996}. We briefly outline likelihood-based and simulation-based calibration. Whatever the calibration criterion, to evaluate it for every candidate parameterization of the model, it is necessary to solve the model again to construct the optimal policy $\pi^*$.

\paragraph{Likelihood-based} The individual chooses the alternative with the highest total value $a_t^{\pi^*}(s_t)$ which is determined by the complete state $s_t$. However, economists only observe the subset $x_t$. Given parametric assumptions about the distribution of $\epsilon_{it}$, we can determine the probability $p_{it}(a_{it}, r_{it} \mid x_{it}, \theta)$ of individual $i$ at time $t$ in $x_{it}$ choosing $a_{it}$ and receiving $r_{it}$.\\

\noindent The likelihood function $\mathcal{L}(\theta\mid\mathcal{D})$ captures the probability of the observed data as a function of $\theta$. The goal of likelihood-based calibration is to find the value of the model parameters $\theta$ that maximizes it:
%
\begin{align*}
  \hat{\theta} \equiv \argmax_{\theta \in \Theta}  \underbrace{\prod^N_{i= 1} \prod^{T_i}_{t= 1}\, p_{it}(a_{it}, r_{it} \mid x_{it}, \theta)}_{\mathcal{L}(\theta\mid\mathcal{D})}.
\end{align*}

\paragraph{Simulation-based}
