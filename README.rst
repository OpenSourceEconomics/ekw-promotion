We present background material on a class of structural microeconometric models to facilitate transdisciplinary collaboration in their future development.
We describe the economic framework, mathematical formulation, and calibration procedures for so-called Eckstein-Keane-Wolpin (EKW) models. We provide an
exemplifying analysis of the seminal model outlined in Keane & Wolpin (1997) and present our group's ensemble of research codes that allow for its
specification, simulation, and calibration. We summarize our efforts drawing on research outside economics to
address the computational challenges in applying EKW models and improve the reliability and interpretability of their results.

This material is under constant development but you can access its most recent version
`here <https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/ekw-promotion/blob/master/promotion>`_.
